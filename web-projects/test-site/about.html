  Building a career on social platforms is like building a home on someone else's
  land. While social platforms are great for discovering and reaching your audience,
  your goal as a creator should be to convert your followers into email or text
  message subscribers. Why? Look no further than TikTok. Almost overnight,
  millions of creative people almost lost their careers.

  If a platform removes your account, or their algorithm for distribution no longer
  favours you, are you prepared?

  If you want to build a career as a creator, your focus should be on building durable
  distribution channels. Without distribution, you have no business. So how can you
  build an audience that you actually own? With emails and phone numbers. These
  distribution channels are direct. Instead of going through some algorithm, when
  you share over email and text message, you know that your audience will see your
  content. Even better is the fact that you own these lists. Instagram removes your
  acount, you're ok. YouTube changes their algorithm, you're ok. You own your
  audience.

  We built Marico to make this process easy, fast, and effective. The traditional
  solution to this problem involves spending days building a website or hiring
  someone expensive to do it for you. But those days are gone. With Marico, you
  get a portfolio that is always up-to-date and converts visitors into email or text
  message subscribers. The best thing? It takes under 5 minutes to setup, and it
  automatically updates whenever you post new content anywhere online. We
  believe the best tools are the ones you don't even notice. Marico helps you build
  your own audience, without any hassle or time commitment. All you have to do is
  share your portfolio link with your audience, and we'll handle the rest.

  You can also create posts from within Marico and share them in just a few clicks
  to your portfolio, and to your email and text message subscribers. Since all of your
  content is already in Marico, creating content takes minutes, not hours.
